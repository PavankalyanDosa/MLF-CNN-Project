Machine Learning Fundamentals: CNN Implementation for MNIST Digit Recognition

This project was completed individually as part of the CSC-722: Machine Learning Fundamentals course.

The aim was to develop and assess a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST Dataset.

The project utilized the MNIST dataset, a widely recognized benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition, accessible in the UCI Machine Learning Repository at this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/80/optical+recognition+of+handwritten+digits

Key tasks undertaken in this solo project include:

1. Data Loading and Initial Examination
2. Data Preprocessing and Splitting
3. CNN Model Definition and Compilation
4. Implementing Cross-Validation in CNN Training
5. CNN Model Training and Evaluation with K-Fold Cross-Validation
6. Visualizing Training and Validation Metrics
